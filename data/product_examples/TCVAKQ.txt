          RESCUES AND EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS ARE POSSIBLE.
        - TO BE SAFE, EARNESTLY PREPARE FOR THE POTENTIAL OF 
          SIGNIFICANT FLOODING RAIN IMPACTS.
        - DANGEROUS FLOODING IS POSSIBLE. FAILURE TO TAKE ACTION MAY 
          RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY OR LOSS OF LIFE. IF FLOOD RELATED 
          WATCHES AND WARNINGS ARE ISSUED, HEED RECOMMENDED ACTIONS.

          MOVING WATER AS STORM DRAINS AND RETENTION PONDS OVERFLOW. 
          DRIVING CONDITIONS BECOME HAZARDOUS. SOME ROAD AND BRIDGE 
          CLOSURES.

        - WINDOW FOR TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS: SATURDAY MORNING
          THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING. 

    - CURRENT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: MODERATE
        - THE WIND THREAT HAS REMAINED NEARLY STEADY FROM THE 
          PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT.
        - EMERGENCY PLANS SHOULD INCLUDE A REASONABLE THREAT FOR 
          STRONG TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND OF 58 TO 73 MPH.
        - TO BE SAFE, EARNESTLY PREPARE FOR THE POTENTIAL OF 
          SIGNIFICANT WIND IMPACTS. REMAINING EFFORTS TO SECURE 
          PROPERTIES SHOULD NOW BE BROUGHT TO COMPLETION.
        - DANGEROUS WIND IS POSSIBLE. FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY SHELTER 
          MAY RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY, OR IN SOME CASES LOSS OF 
          LIFE. MOVE TO SAFE SHELTER BEFORE THE WIND BECOMES 
          HAZARDOUS.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: SIGNIFICANT
        - SOME DAMAGE TO ROOFING AND SIDING, ALONG WITH DAMAGE TO 
          PORCHES, AWNINGS, CARPORTS, AND SHEDS. A FEW BUILDINGS

        - TO BE SAFE, PREPARE FOR THE POTENTIAL OF LIMITED STORM 
          SURGE FLOODING IMPACTS. EFFORTS SHOULD NOW BE BROUGHT TO 
          COMPLETION BEFORE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE.
        - LOCALIZED INUNDATION IS POSSIBLE. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS 
          OF LOCAL OFFICIALS. CONSIDER VOLUNTARY EVACUATION IF

          RESCUES AND EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS ARE LIKELY.
        - TO BE SAFE, AGGRESSIVELY PREPARE FOR THE POTENTIAL OF 
          EXTENSIVE FLOODING RAIN IMPACTS.

          SWOLLEN AND OVERFLOW.
        - FLOOD WATERS MAY ENTER A FEW STRUCTURES, ESPECIALLY IN 
          USUALLY VULNERABLE SPOTS. A FEW PLACES WHERE RAPID PONDING 
          OF WATER OCCURS AT UNDERPASSES, LOW-LYING SPOTS, AND POOR 
          DRAINAGE AREAS. SOME STORM DRAINS AND RETENTION PONDS 
          BECOME NEAR-FULL AND BEGIN TO OVERFLOW. SOME BRIEF ROAD AND

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: LIMITED
        - LOCALIZED FLOODING FROM HEAVY RAINFALL MAY PROMPT A FEW 
          EVACUATIONS

          CURRENTS. SMALL STREAMS, CREEKS, AND DITCHES MAY BECOME 
          SWOLLEN AND OVERFLOW.
        - FLOOD WATERS MAY ENTER A FEW STRUCTURES, ESPECIALLY IN 
          USUALLY VULNERABLE SPOTS. A FEW PLACES WHERE RAPID PONDING 
          OF WATER OCCURS AT UNDERPASSES, LOW-LYING SPOTS, AND POOR 
          DRAINAGE AREAS. SOME STORM DRAINS AND RETENTION PONDS 
          BECOME NEAR-FULL AND BEGIN TO OVERFLOW. SOME BRIEF ROAD AND 
          BRIDGE CLOSURES.
