AREAS AFFECTED...PORTIONS OF NRN WI AND THE UPPER PENINSULA OF MI

CONCERNING...SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH 446...

VALID 260208Z - 260415Z

THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH 446
CONTINUES.

SUMMARY...THE SVR THREAT PERSISTS ACROSS WW 446.

DISCUSSION...CONVECTION CONTINUES TO SPREAD ESEWD INVOF A
W/E-ELONGATED...WAVY...QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT LYING APPROXIMATELY
ALONG THE WI/MI UPPER PENINSULA BORDER. WITH RELATIVELY LIMITED
BUOYANCY IN PLACE IN THE ABSENCE OF RICHER LOW-LEVEL
MOISTURE...INSTABILITY IS RELATIVELY MINIMAL AS OBSERVED FROM THE
00Z GRB RAOB. HOWEVER...LOW-LEVEL ASCENT -- PRIMARILY FOCUSED AROUND
THE CONVECTION-MODULATED FRONT -- WILL LIKELY PROMOTE THE
MAINTENANCE OF CONVECTIVE CLUSTERS...WHILE THIS ASCENT BECOMES
AUGMENTED BY DCVA PRECEDING AN APPROACHING COMPACT MID-LEVEL VORT
MAX. THE VERTICAL WIND PROFILE...AS OBSERVED BY MQT/GRB VWP DATA AND
THE AFOREMENTIONED 00Z SOUNDING...FEATURES VERTICALLY VEERING WINDS
BELOW 3 KM AGL BENEATH AROUND 25-30 KT OF MID-LEVEL FLOW TO SUPPORT
ORGANIZED/SUSTAINED STORM STRUCTURES. DMGG WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN
CONCERN WITH THIS ACTIVITY...THOUGH THE POSSIBILITY OF A TORNADO
CANNOT BE RULED OUT.

THE SVR THREAT SHOULD BECOME RELATIVELY MINIMAL WELL N OF THE
AFOREMENTIONED FRONT IN THE MI UPPER PENINSULA WHERE BOUNDARY-LAYER
THETA-E DEFICITS ARE BEING REINFORCED BENEATH THE STRATIFORM RAIN
SHIELD. SIMILARLY...THE SVR THREAT WILL GREATLY LESSEN BEHIND THE
ESEWD-MOVING CLUSTER OF STORMS OVER NWRN WI OWING TO CONVECTIVE
OVERTURNING AND RELATED BOUNDARY-LAYER STABILIZATION.
