Areas affected...southwestern Iowa and far northwestern Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 251944Z - 252145Z

CORRECTED FOR GRAPHIC

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Storms capable of hail, gusty wind, and an isolated
tornado possible through the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Low top thunderstorm development has been ongoing near
the surface low and front across western Iowa into northwestern
Missouri. Surface observations have shown slow warming and
moistening of a relatively cool and stable boundary layer through
the morning, with temperatures now in the upper 50s to mid 60s and
dew points in the 50s. Though the thermal profile is marginal
(around 500 J/kg MUCAPE), steep low-level lapse rates around 7-8
C/km will continue to nose into southern Iowa through the afternoon.
Given the proximity of the low, steep lapse rates, and modest
low-level curvature of hodographs, a funnel cloud or isolated
tornado could be possible. A few instances of gusty winds or hail
will be possible. A watch is unlikely to be needed at this time.
