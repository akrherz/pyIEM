...NWS Damage Survey for 03/16/23 Tornado Event...

.Overview...
Severe thunderstorms moved across North Texas during the late afternoon
and evening of March 16, 2023, producing wind and tornado damage at
multiple locations. A National Weather Service Fort Worth storm survey team
assessed damage in 3 general areas today, and confirmed 3 EF-1 tornadoes - 2 in
Dallas County near Grand Prairie and Irving, and one in Navarro County near
Corsicana.  In addition, a small area of damage was assessed in the City of
Garland in eastern Dallas County.  This damage was determined to be due to
straight-line winds associated with a brief thunderstorm downburst event.
Additional data will be assessed in the coming days, and updates will be
issued as necessary.
