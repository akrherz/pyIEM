Summary: The tornado initially touched down in a forested area in
Panola County off of CR-3123. There, approximately 200 softwood
trees were snapped and uprooted across an area around 460 yards
wide. The tornado damage swath narrowed as it continued to do
roof damage to a single family home off of CR-312 and CR-3123.
The tornado continued to snap and uproot trees as it continues to
cross FM-31 and crossed into Harrison County. The tornado then
crossed Old Town Road (CR-1202) and FM-451, as it continued to
uproot trees and down large branches. The tornado then paralleled
CR-1214 as it continue to do tree damage. It finally crossed FM-
9 and hit a two story home, removing large portions of the roof
before it lifted shortly after. 

A special thanks goes out to the Texas Division of Emergency 
Management (TDEM) and the Panola County and Harrison County 
Emergency Management teams for their assistance in locating 
damage during the survey.
