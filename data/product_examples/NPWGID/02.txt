...DENSE FOG ADVISORY IS CANCELLED...

While there may be some areas of reduced visibility in fog through
the early morning, widespread dense fog appears unlikely.
Travelers overnight should expect localized reduced visibilities 
in low lying areas such as river valleys through sunrise. The
visibility may be down to less than one half mile at times but
could vary widely from one location to the next. For most of the
area, visibilities should be at least a few miles.
