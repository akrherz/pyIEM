National Weather Service Quad Cities IA IL
1035 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2020

...HEAVY SNOW POSSIBLE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY...

.A slow moving winter storm system moving out of the southern
plains is expected to bring snow across eastern Iowa and 
northwest Illinois Monday night, which will continue through 
Tuesday night. Precipitation will start out as rain during the 
day Monday which will change to snow Monday evening. Snow may be 
moderate to heavy at times, especially Tuesday through Tuesday 
night. Increasing north to northwest winds may cause blowing and 
drifting snow Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.

specific snowfall amounts, there is above average confidence that 
this system will produce heavy snowfall amounts over portions of 
the watch area.
