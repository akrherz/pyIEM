Tropical Depression Delta Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL262020
1000 AM CDT Sat Oct 10 2020

Surface observations, Doppler radar data, and satellite imagery 
indicate that Delta has continued to weaken as it moves from 
northeastern Louisiana into western Mississippi.  There are no 
recent surface observations of sustained tropical-storm-force 
winds in the areas where the radar data show the strongest winds 
are occurring, so based on this the initial intensity is reduced to 
30 kt.  It should be noted that wind gusts to tropical-storm force 
are still occurring over portions of northern Mississippi and 
southeastern Arkansas, and these should continue through this 
afternoon.

The initial motion is now northeastward or 035/14.  The flow 
between a mid-to upper-level ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and the 
mid-latitude westerlies over the United States should steer Delta 
or its remnants generally northeastward until the system 
dissipates.  The new forecast track has only minor adjustments from 
the previous forecast, and it lies near the consensus models.

Continued weakening is expected, and Delta is forecast to 
degenerate to a remnant low pressure area in about 24 h.  The 
global models are in good agreement that the cyclone should weaken 
to a trough between 48-60 h, and the intensity forecast follows 
this scenario.

This is the last advisory on Delta issued by the National Hurricane 
Center.  Future information on this system can be found in Public
Advisories issued by the Weather Prediction Center beginning at     
4 PM CDT, under AWIPS header TCPAT1, WMO header WTNT31 KWNH, and on
