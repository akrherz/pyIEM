was located near latitude 34.5 North, longitude 84.1 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east near 15 mph, and 
this motion is expected to continue tonight and Monday morning. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 15 mph (30 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some further weakening is possible tonight as a new surface low 
develops in the Carolinas, and Delta's surface low is expected to 
be absorbed by this new low pressure area on Monday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Across the Mid-Atlantic, 1 to 3 inches of rain, with

flooding are possible, but overall hydrologic impacts are expected
to be minimal.
 
Moderate to major river flooring will continue across the Calcasieu
and Mermentau river basins in Louisiana through much of next week
